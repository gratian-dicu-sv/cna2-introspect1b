```
my application consists of 2 microservices defined using docker, both microservices are written in javascript (node.js). The workflow is a simple one the product microservice once it creates a new product it will also inform the order service about this new product. The order product in this state will need to subscribe and receive the event. The events are sent using sidecar pattern (DAPR) integrated inside azure container application. These are set to autoscale from 1 to a maximum of 5. Please suggest missing telemetry points and retry logic, and explain how to scale pub/sub systems for load spikes having in consideration that the DAPR system uses Redis, ACA with a setup of 1 min am d 5 max with an http rule set to 90%

Got it — you have two Node.js microservices (product and order), running in Azure Container Apps (ACA) with Dapr sidecars for pub/sub, using Redis as the broker. You’re scaling ACA from 1 to 5 replicas based on HTTP concurrency (90% rule). You want advice on:

* Missing telemetry points
* Retry logic
* Scaling pub/sub for load spikes with Redis in Dapr

### 1. Missing Telemetry Points
Right now, ACA + Dapr will give you some basic metrics, but for a production-ready event-driven setup, you should add application-level and infrastructure-level telemetry.

#### Application-level telemetry

You should capture:

1. Event publishing metrics
* Count of events successfully published to Dapr pub/sub
* Count of publish failures (with error details)
* Publish latency (time from request to Dapr ACK)
* Event payload size distribution

2. Event consumption metrics
* Count of events received per topic
* Processing latency per event (time from receive → business logic complete)
* Count of processing failures (and reasons)
* Dead-letter queue (DLQ) count (if using one)

3. End-to-end trace IDs
* Use OpenTelemetry or Azure Monitor Application Insights to propagate trace IDs from product → Dapr → Redis → order service
* This helps correlate a product creation event to the order service processing it

4. Backlog depth
* Redis pub/sub in Dapr doesn’t store messages by default (it’s fire-and-forget), but if you switch to Redis Streams or Azure Service Bus, you can measure queue depth to know if you’re falling behind

5. Autoscaling triggers correlation
* Log when ACA scales up/down and correlate with event throughput and latency

#### Infrastructure-level telemetry
From Azure Monitor / Container Apps:

* CPU and memory usage per container (app + sidecar separately if possible)
* Dapr sidecar metrics:
    * dapr_runtime_pubsub_sent_bytes_total
    * dapr_runtime_pubsub_received_bytes_total
    * dapr_runtime_pubsub_events_total
    * Sidecar HTTP/gRPC request latency
* Redis metrics:
    * CPU usage, memory usage, connected clients
    * Commands/sec
    * Network in/out
    * Latency spikes
    * Evictions (if memory limit is reached)

### 2. Retry Logic
In Dapr, retries can happen in two places:

#### Publisher side (Product service)
* If publish fails (network/Dapr/Redis unavailable), implement:
    * Immediate retry: Retry 2–3 times with exponential backoff (e.g., 200ms, 500ms, 1s)
    * Fallback: Push the event to a persistent store (e.g., Azure Storage Queue) for later replay
* Use idempotent event IDs so that retries don’t cause duplicate processing

#### Subscriber side (Order service)
* Dapr pub/sub has a delivery guarantee: at-least-once delivery if the broker supports persistence.
Redis pub/sub is fire-and-forget — if the subscriber is down, the event is lost. Consider:
    * Using Redis Streams instead of pub/sub (supports persistence and replay)
    * Or switch to Azure Service Bus for guaranteed delivery and dead-letter queues
* If processing fails:
    * Return a non-2xx HTTP status from your subscriber endpoint → Dapr will retry based on the broker’s retry policy
    * Implement exponential backoff and a max retry count
    * Send to DLQ after max retries

### 3. Scaling Pub/Sub for Load Spikes
Right now, your ACA scaling is:

* Min: 1
* Max: 5
* HTTP concurrency rule: scale when >90% concurrency

*Considerations:*

* Pub/sub message processing is not triggered by HTTP concurrency rules — Dapr delivers messages to your subscriber endpoint over HTTP, but ACA scaling rules may not see that as normal HTTP traffic unless you expose metrics.
* ACA supports KEDA-based scaling — you can scale on:
    * Redis Streams length (redis-streams scaler)
    * Azure Service Bus queue/topic depth
    * Custom Prometheus metrics (e.g., Dapr sidecar metrics)

*For Redis Pub/Sub*
* Problem: Redis pub/sub has no backlog — scaling can only be proactive, based on CPU/memory or incoming traffic rate
* Better approach: Switch to Redis Streams or Service Bus so you have a measurable backlog and can scale reactively

*Scaling strategy*
1. Separate scaling for publisher and subscriber
    * Publisher: scale on CPU/memory or HTTP request rate
    * Subscriber: scale on queue depth (if using Streams) or CPU usage
2. Overprovision during spikes
* If spikes are predictable, schedule scaling rules in ACA (time-based scaling)
3. Reduce event processing latency
    * Batch processing in the subscriber (if business logic allows)
4. Use Dapr pub/sub bulk subscribe (reduces HTTP overhead when messages are high-volume)

### 4. Recommended Adjustments for Your Setup
* *Telemetry*
    * Enable Application Insights with OpenTelemetry in both services
    * Export Dapr metrics to Azure Monitor
    * Track publish/consume counts, latency, and failures
    * Add correlation IDs to all events
* *Resilience*
    * Implement retry + DLQ
    * Consider Redis Streams or Azure Service Bus for persistence
    * Use idempotency keys
* *Scaling*
    * Use KEDA scaler for Redis Streams or Service Bus instead of HTTP concurrency rule
    * Increase max replicas if spikes are large
    * Consider pre-warming instances if spikes are predictable

### ✅ Next Step Recommendation

If you want guaranteed delivery and better scaling signals, migrate from Redis Pub/Sub to Redis Streams or Azure Service Bus. This will let you:

* Measure backlog length
* Scale subscribers based on real queue depth
* Avoid message loss during subscriber downtime

## **Flow Explanation**  
  
1. **Product Service**  
   - Receives HTTP requests to create a product    
   - Publishes an event to Dapr pub/sub bound to **Redis Streams**    
   - Adds a unique event ID for idempotency  
  
2. **Redis Streams**  
   - Stores events until they are consumed    
   - Allows backlog measurement (`XLEN` command)    
   - Durable — events survive subscriber restarts  
  
3. **Order Service**  
   - Dapr sidecar subscribes to the topic (stream)    
   - When events arrive, Dapr POSTs them to `/orders/new-product` endpoint    
   - Order service processes event and ACKs    
   - If processing fails, Dapr retries with backoff  
  
4. **Scaling**  
   - **Publisher** scales on CPU or HTTP request rate    
   - **Subscriber** scales using **KEDA Redis Streams scaler** based on backlog length    
     - Example: If backlog > 100 messages, add more replicas until max is reached  
  
5. **Telemetry**  
   - **Application Insights** collects traces, logs, and custom metrics    
   - **Dapr metrics** exported to Azure Monitor (via Prometheus endpoint)    
   - Redis performance metrics collected from Azure Cache for Redis

## **KEDA Scaling Rule Example (Subscriber)**  
  
```yaml  
scale:  
  minReplicas: 1  
  maxReplicas: 10  
  rules:  
    - name: redis-streams-scaler  
      type: redis-streams  
      metadata:  
        address: REDIS_HOST:6379  
        passwordFromEnv: REDIS_PASSWORD  
        stream: product-events  
        consumerGroup: order-service  
        pendingEntriesCount: "100"  
```  
  
**Explanation:**  
- If there are **>100 pending messages** in the `product-events` stream for the `order-service` consumer group, scale up.  
  
---  
  
## **Why This Works Better than HTTP Concurrency Scaling**  
- HTTP concurrency scaling only reacts to *current* requests — it doesn’t see a growing backlog in the broker.    
- Redis Streams + KEDA lets you **scale based on actual event load** even if subscribers are temporarily offline.    
- You can handle **sudden spikes** by scaling subscribers faster, without over-scaling publishers.  
  
---  
  
✅ **Next Step Suggestion:**    
We can extend this with a **Retry + Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** flow in the diagram so you can visualize what happens when the order service fails to process events after multiple retries.

Do you want me to **add the DLQ flow into this Markdown diagram** so it’s fully production-ready? That would make it complete for real-world deployments.
